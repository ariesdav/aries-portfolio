                    I&#39;m an Informatics Engineering student with a strong interest in data.
                    Whether it&#39;s numbers, text, or visuals, I enjoy turning raw data into something meaningful.
                </p>
                <p className="mt-2 leading-relaxed text-gray-300">
                    My passion for data started from my love for math and statistics, which eventually led me to explore the field of data science.
                    I especially enjoy working with Python, Machine Learning, Deep Learning especially focusing on Natural Language Processing.
                </p>
                <p className="mt-2 leading-relaxed text-gray-300">
                    Along the way, I&#39;ve become comfortable using libraries and tools like Tensorflow, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, and more.
                    I like exploring data, discovering patterns, and turning them into insights that matter.
